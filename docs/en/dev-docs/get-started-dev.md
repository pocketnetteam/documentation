# Platform overview
 
Welcome to Bastyon developer documentation. Here you will find a lot of useful information, including how to get started, platform architectural overview, as well as the API reference.

Bastyon is an innovative, open-source social network and video sharing platform designed to prioritize freedom of speech and user privacy. Unlike mainstream social networks, Bastyon operates without centralized corporate control, instead relying on a distributed network of nodes worldwide. For more information, you can check out [get started](/get-started.md) section of the documentation.

> **Vision:**
Bastyon aims to create a resilient, decentralized ecosystem that empowers individuals with unrestricted access to communication, information, and personal data management. Our vision is to build a platform that stands strong against censorship and ensures user sovereignty in the digital realm.

The platform operates on a distributed network of nodes running the Bastyon blockchain, which is based on a randomized Proof-of-Stake algorithm. This decentralized architecture ensures that no single entity can control or censor the platform.
Cryptocurrency Integration.
Bastyon utilizes its native cryptocurrency, [PKOIN](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/pocketcoin+), for incentivizing content creators and node operators.



## Architecture and Design

The application flow architecture largerly depends on the content, users are interacting with. From a high-level, the architecture of Bastyon looks like the following:

## API reference

### Overview

All nodes of the network have an identical database, which allows clients to communicate with any node without fear of inconsistency. The client can switch between nodes "inside the session", can use the API to increase performance or for additional verification of the "honesty" of the node. The same API method can be called on two or more nodes to make sure that the data is consistent and correct.

From the client side, the node network can be represented as a single cloud with a standardized API. Here are a few paradigms that should be provided by each node in such a cloud:

- The node must provide access to the cloud with at least one entry point, providing a minimal API for working with data.

- The node must have a minimum set of public service API (getnodeinfo, getpeerinfo).

- The node must have database validation mechanisms - for example, the sum of all ratings or a hash of data.

### Public access

The node must provide access to the API in the following ways:

- HTTP via port `38081`

- WS TCP via port `38082`

- WS UDP via port `38083`

- WS TCP via a dynamic port determined by the STUN method using peers with externally accessible interfaces 1-3

- WS UDP via a dynamic port determined by the STUN method using peers with externally accessible interfaces 1-3

### STUN Ports

To implement access to a node via NAT, the node must launch a UDP or TCP socket to determine its external IP address (`STUN-Address`) and port (`STUN-Port`), which may differ due to the use of NAT routing.

To implement this mechanism, the node must run one `STUN-Server` socket and `N STUN-Client` sockets, one for each connected peer.

`STUN-Server` socket acts as a STUN server and helps other nodes determine their external IP and port.

`STUN-Client` sockets are used to determine the nodeâ€™s external IP address and "reserve" the port in the NAT routing table.

Thus, each node, in addition to the local IP address and static open ports, can receive an external IP address and a set of ports for external connections. As long as the node maintains a connection to the peer, the port remains open and in most cases the NAT will skip incoming connection requests from clients.

Nodes should ensure the exchange of information about known STUN data between nodes and clients:

- API methods `getnodeinfo` and `getpeerinfo` should return `STUN` data

- Nodes must receive and send their `STUN` data to known peers

- Nodes must save `STUN` data of peers who requested data via `STUN-Server`

## Bastyon Moderation

### Flags

Reports allow users to flag content as objectionable (post or comment and author). Reports can be sent by users with the "Shark" badge (see API).

The numeric value `REASON` is used to distinguish between complaints:

1. Pornography
2. Pedophilia - any even remotely suggestive images/videos/texts with children or adolescents
3. Direct threat of violence
4. Illegal narcotics - any positive or promotion of illegal narcotics
5. Copyrighted content (with clear proof from the owner)


#### Conditions for creating a jury

Any flag can initiate the creation of a "jury". If the jury is initiated, all subsequent flags are ignored. To create a jury, the following rules are taken into account:

- The account in question is not in an active ban
- Number of flags with the same `REASON`, `CONTENT_TX_HASH` and `ADDRESS_HASH` must be `>= [main:20, test:5, reg:2]`
- Search depth for similar flags `FLAG_HEIGHT > (CURRENT_HEIGHT - [main:43200, test:4320, reg:10])`


### Transaction

`OP_RETURN` code

`6d6f64466c6167`


#### Payload structure
```json
{
    "s2": "<CONTENT_TX_HASH>",
    "s3": "<ADDRESS_HASH>",
    "i1": "<REASON>"
}
```


### Jury

The jury is not a transaction, it is a record in the database and contains the following fields:

- `juryid` - Hash of the Flag that initiates the creation of the jury.
- `accountid` - Address of the account, the author of the content.
- `reason` - Numerical code of the reason for the complaint.

Together with the jury's entry, the moderators are selected:

- To filter the list of moderators, the transaction hash of the `FLAG_HASH` flag that initiated the creation of the jury is used.
- The hash of the moderator account registration transaction `ACCOUNT_HASH` is used as moderator sorting.
- To decide the jury's question, TM accounts `[main:80, test:6 reg:4]` are selected
- For an even distribution of moderators, accounts are selected according to the following conditions:
  * Selected TM/2 accounts where `ACCOUNT_HASH < FLAG_HASH`
  * Selected TM/2 accounts where `ACCOUNT_HASH > FLAG_HASH`


### Vote

The moderator's vote, which has two values `0|1` indicating whether the moderator agrees with the complaints or not. Any vote may initiate a jury verdict.

- The verdict is positive if the vote satisfies the condition that it is the Nth positive vote `[main:8, test:3, reg:2]`.
- A negative verdict is issued along with the first negative vote of any moderator.
- After a verdict (positive or negative) is passed, all votes are ignored.
- A jury without a verdict is indefinite.

#### Transaction

`OP_RETURN` code

`6d6f64566f7465`


#### Payload structure
```json
{
    "s2": "<JURY_ID>",
    "i1": "<VERDICT>"
}
```

`JURY_ID` - hash of the flag transaction that initiated the jury

`VERDICT` - numeric value `0|1`


### Ban Account

An account ban, like a jury, is not a transaction. It is a record in the database and contains the following fields:

- Link to the voice initiating the blocking.
- Link to the account, the author of the content.
- Height of the end of blocking. The blocking period is determined based on the rules:
  * First lock - `[main:43200, test:5000, reg:100]` blocks
  * Second lock - `[main:129600, test:10000, reg:200]` blocks
  * Third lock - `[main:51840000, test:15000, reg:1000]` blocks

An account blocked by a node is not allowed to create Social transactions, but can create monetary transactions without restrictions.

Other accounts have the right to perform actions with a blocked account (put ratings, comments, etc.).


>***Rules for hiding content and accounts #In developing#***: Accounts that are in the active jury, banned or have N active complaints should be hidden from the feed and search.


### API

#### Badges definition

The `getuserstate` method returns, among other things, a `badges` object with a list of "badges" available to the user:

```json
> /rpc/getuserstate <address>

{
    "result": "success",
    "data": {
        ...
        "badges": [
            "shark",
            "moderator",
            "developer"
        ],
        ...
    }
}
```


#### List of all jury

```json
> /rpc/getalljury

{
    "result": "success",
