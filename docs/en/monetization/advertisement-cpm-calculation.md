### CPM Calculation

1. Every boost ad runs for 3 hours. So, we divide total monthly visits by 30 days and by 8 to get 3-hour intervals
2. Total monthly visits = 815 thousand
3. Total daily visits = 27,100
4. English feed has 10% of all visitors
5. Total visits in 3 hour interval = 27,100/8 = 3395
6. Average cost of ad is $1
7. CPM = $. 29
8. 29 cents on average is a very low CPM
