# Overview

Bastyon is an innovative, open-source social network and video sharing platform designed to prioritize freedom of speech and user privacy. Unlike mainstream social networks, Bastyon operates without centralized corporate control, instead relying on a distributed network of nodes worldwide.

> **Vision:**
Bastyon aims to create a resilient, decentralized ecosystem that empowers individuals with unrestricted access to communication, information, and personal data management. Our vision is to build a platform that stands strong against censorship and ensures user sovereignty in the digital realm.


Key Features:

1. Decentralized Architecture

   Bastyon's infrastructure is built on a global network of nodes, ensuring continuous accessibility and resilience against censorship attempts.

2. Anonymity and Privacy

   Users can register without providing personal information such as email addresses or phone numbers. Bastyon does not store IP or MAC addresses, safeguarding user identities from potential tracking or surveillance.

3. Censorship Resistance

   By design, Bastyon enables users to connect, view content, and post freely as long as they have an internet connection, without fear of content removal or account suspension due to ideological differences.

4. Open-Source Development

   A team of dedicated developers and experts collaboratively maintain and improve the platform, fostering transparency and community involvement.

5. Cryptocurrency Integration

   Bastyon incorporates its own cryptocurrency, facilitating secure and decentralized transactions within the platform.

Founded by Daniel Satchkov, Bastyon aims to provide a secure, anonymous social platform where users can communicate and share content without the risk of corporate or government interference. This commitment to digital freedom sets Bastyon apart in the landscape of social media.
