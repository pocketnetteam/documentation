After the synchronization ends, you will see a message that your node cannot win bets. To activate this function, deposit at least 50 PKOIN to the account and wait 60 minutes.

You will need to deposit PKOIN to earn bets, click "Deposit". After clicking "Deposit" you will see the PKOIN address. You can copy the address and send PKOIN to it. If you haven't bought PKOIN yet, you can buy it in the following ways:

* Buy for cryptocurrency on pkoin.net (or on DigiFinex or Bitforex exchanges)

* Buy it by selecting the PKOIN/Peer-to-Peer tag on the left side of the Bastyon app. Choose a seller and write to him in the chat (at your own risk)

WARNING: Until the synchronization is completed, if you deposit Pkoin to the node's account, the balance will not be displayed, wait for the end of synchronization.


== Wallet

In this example, you can see that the node is fully synchronized and 500 PKOIN has been deposited. Note that your node wallet is separated from your Bastyon wallet by default, they are not connected. After making PKOIN, you need to go through 60 blocks (about 60 minutes). As soon as you see the green check mark with the inscription Betting, you are ready to start earning PKOIN. You can log in periodically and see how your balance changes with winning bets.

•  Withdraw PKOIN (reduces your chance of winning coins)
•  Export wallet (the backup wallet of the node, very important, saves your private keys in case of failure of your node or computer). Be sure to save this file on another storage medium for security.
•  Import Wallet (you can import an external wallet with private keys)
